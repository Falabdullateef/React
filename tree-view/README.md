A Tree View shows information in a folder-like structure. Think of it like folders and files on your computer - you can open folders to see what's inside.

## Where You Might Use It

## Example
```
└── Animals
    ├── Mammals
    │   ├── Dog
    │   └── Cat
    └── Birds
        ├── Eagle
        └── Sparrow
```

A tree view helps users explore and understand related information in a simple, organized way.
