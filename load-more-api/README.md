# Load More Photos Example

This is a typical front-end interview task: create a "Load More" button that retrieves and shows more photos from an online source until a set maximum is reached.

## Requirements

- Get photos from an online API (for example, JSONPlaceholder Photos).
- Show only a few photos at first.
- When "Load More" is clicked, show more photos.
- Stop loading when the maximum number of photos is shown.

## How It Works

Start by showing a small set of photos. Each time the user clicks "Load More", more photos are added to the list. Once the maximum number is reached, the button disappears or becomes inactive.

## Tips

- You can change how many photos are shown at a time or the total number allowed.
- Use any photo API you like.
- For real projects, remember to handle loading and error messages.
