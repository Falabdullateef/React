# React Web Components with UIverse

This project uses prebuilt designs from [UIverse](https://uiverse.io) and adapts them into reusable React components. The goal is to integrate beautiful UI elements into React projects easily.

## About

I found UIverse, a site with amazing prebuilt UI components, and decided to bring some of those designs into React. This project is a collection of those components, styled with `styled-components` and made interactive for React apps.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: Prebuilt designs adapted for React.
- **Customizable**: Easily tweak styles and behavior.
- **Interactive**: Includes components like toggle switches and more.

## Inspiration

Inspired by [UIverse](https://uiverse.io), this project brings their designs into React for easy use in modern web apps.
